# E-Voting System (C with Linked List)

Welcome to the E-Voting System project implemented in C using Linked Lists. This project provides a digital platform for efficient and secure voting processes.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Voters are required to provide their Aadhar ID, name, and birth date for authentication before casting their votes.

- **Secure Voting**: The system ensures that each voter can cast only one vote.

- **Real-time Vote Counting**: Votes are counted in real-time, and the system displays the results after each vote.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows (due to the use of the `windows.h` library).
- **C Compiler**: You'll need a C compiler like GCC to compile the source code.
